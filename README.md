### MEETING MINUTES
| Date | Agenda | Discussions | ActionsTaken | Additional Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 28/04/17 | * Coming up with a heuristics for SliderBot1 (our first bot) | - Additional heuristics is taken into account: (1.) Choosing pieces to be moved is based on the number of pieces blocking or potentially blocking the path to victory 2. Movement should achieve 2 goals: bringing the pieces closer to end_goal AND blocking opponent's pieces and forcing ineffective movement | > RICKY: create a SliderBot1 (that implements A-star algorithm) and RandomBot (that choose random legal move) to be used as an opponent CON: create a diagram that should explain how MINIMAX algorithm works and how to implement it | Next meeting Friday 5th May (18 Days remaining) |
